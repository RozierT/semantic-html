# semantic-html

## Description

In this challenge I took a webpage with non-semantic tags such as <div> and <span> and replaced them with semantic HTML tags and added alt tags to images to make the web page more accessable for a larger audience, improve SEO of the website, and to have a cleaner code overall. Adding semantic tags to the HTML broke the css style sheet and so the next challenge was to repair the css sheet so that the correct styles were applied to the website.

After the css sheet was repaired and the correct styles were applied to the website, I went through the CSS sheet and refactored it to reduce the total number of lines of code and to make it easier to understand.
