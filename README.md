# semantic-html
#In this challenge I took a webpage with non-semantic tags such as <div> and <span> and replaced them with semantic HTML tags to make the web page more accessable for a larger audience

#I also went through the CSS sheet and refactored it reducing the total number of lines of code and made it easier to understand

#Lastly I added alt tags to images and a content description in the head to increase SEO for this site
